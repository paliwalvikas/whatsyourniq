## Quick Start
In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
3. [Enable the Cloud Vision API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/vision.googleapis.com)
4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-vision/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html)

### Installation
```
$ gem install google-cloud-vision
```

### Migration Guide

The 0.32.0 release introduced breaking changes relative to the previous release,

### Preview
#### ImageAnnotatorClient
```rb
require "google/cloud/vision"

image_annotator_client = Google::Cloud::Vision::ImageAnnotator.new
gcs_image_uri = "gs://cloud-samples-data/vision/face_detection/celebrity_recognition/sergey.jpg"
source = { gcs_image_uri: gcs_image_uri }
image = { source: source }
type = :FACE_DETECTION
features_element = { type: type }
features = [features_element]
requests_element = { image: image, features: features }
requests = [requests_element]
response = image_annotator_client.batch_annotate_images(requests)
```

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest)
that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
