      # # Project
      #
      # Represents the project that pubsub messages are pushed to and pulled
      # from. {Topic} is a named resource to which messages are sent by
      # publishers. {Subscription} is a named resource representing the stream
      # of messages from a single, specific topic, to be delivered to the
      # subscribing application. {Message} is a combination of data and
      # attributes that a publisher sends to a topic and is eventually delivered
      # to subscribers.
      #
      # See {Google::Cloud#pubsub}
