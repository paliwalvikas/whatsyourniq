      #   @return [String]
      #     The resource name of the bucket.
      #     For example:

      # Describes a sink used to export log entries to one of the following
      # destinations in any project: a Cloud Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a
      # Cloud Pub/Sub topic. A logs filter controls which log entries are exported.
      # The sink must be created within a project, organization, billing account, or
      # folder.
      # @!attribute [rw] name
      #   @return [String]
      #     Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example:
      #     `"my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub"`. Sink identifiers are limited to 100
      #     characters and can include only the following characters: upper and
      #     lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
      #     First character has to be alphanumeric.
      # @!attribute [rw] destination
      #   @return [String]
      #     Required. The export destination:
      #
      #         "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
      #         "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
      #         "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
      #
      #     The sink's `writer_identity`, set when the sink is created, must
      #     have permission to write to the destination or else the log
      #     entries are not exported. For more information, see
      #     [Exporting Logs with Sinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
      # @!attribute [rw] filter
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. An [advanced logs filter](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only
      #     exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and
      #     that match the filter. For example:
      #
      #         logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR
      # @!attribute [rw] description
      #   @return [String]

      #     The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.

      #     export any log entries.
      # @!attribute [rw] output_version_format
      #   @return [Google::Logging::V2::LogSink::VersionFormat]
      #     Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log
      #     entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.
      # @!attribute [rw] writer_identity
      #   @return [String]
      #     Output only. An IAM identityâ€“a service account or group&mdash;under which Logging
      #     writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is
      #     set by {Google::Logging::V2::ConfigServiceV2#create_sink} and
      #     {Google::Logging::V2::ConfigServiceV2#update_sink} based on the
      #     value of `unique_writer_identity` in those methods.
      #
      #     Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry
      #     exports from this sink will fail. For more information,
      #     see [Granting Access for a
      #     Resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource).
      #     Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the
      #     appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
      # @!attribute [rw] include_children
      #   @return [true, false]
      #     Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and
      #     folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the
      #     sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then
      #     logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the
      #     sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular
      #     log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter
      #     expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter
      #     `resource.type=gce_instance` would export all Compute Engine VM instance
      #     log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries
      #     from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:
      #
      #         logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND
      #         resource.type=gce_instance

      #     tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables). By default, Logging
      #     creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g.
      #     syslog_20170523. With partitioned tables the date suffix is no longer
      #     present and [special query
      #     syntax](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) has to be used instead.
      #     In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone.
      # @!attribute [rw] uses_timestamp_column_partitioning
      #   @return [true, false]
      #     Output only. True if new timestamp column based partitioning is in use,
      #     false if legacy ingestion-time partitioning is in use.
      #     All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column
      #     based partitioning. If use_partitioned_tables is false, this value has no
      #     meaning and will be false. Legacy sinks using partitioned tables will have
      #     this field set to false.
