        #     `placement.clusterSelector.zone`.
        #
        #     Also, field paths can reference fields using the following syntax:
        #
        #     * Values in maps can be referenced by key:
        #       * labels['key']
        #         * placement.clusterSelector.clusterLabels['key']

        #
        #         * Jobs in the jobs list can be referenced by step-id:
        #         * jobs['step-id'].hadoopJob.mainJarFileUri
        #         * jobs['step-id'].hiveJob.queryFileUri

        #         * jobs['step-id'].pySparkJob.pythonFileUris[0]
        #
        #         * Items in repeated fields can be referenced by a zero-based index:
        #         * jobs['step-id'].sparkJob.args[0]
        #
        #         * Other examples:
