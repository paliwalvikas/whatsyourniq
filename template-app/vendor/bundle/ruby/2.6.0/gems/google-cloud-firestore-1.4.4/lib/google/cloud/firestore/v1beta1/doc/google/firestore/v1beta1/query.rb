      #     Firestore guarantees a stable ordering through the following rules:
      #
      #     * Any field required to appear in `order_by`, that is not already
      #       specified in `order_by`, is appended to the order in field name order
      #       by default.
      #     * If an order on `__name__` is not specified, it is appended by default.
      #
      #     Fields are appended with the same sort direction as the last order
      #     specified, or 'ASCENDING' if no order was specified. For example:
      #
      #     * `SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A` becomes
      #       `SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A, __name__`
      #     * `SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A DESC` becomes
      #       `SELECT * FROM Foo ORDER BY A DESC, __name__ DESC`
      #     * `SELECT * FROM Foo WHERE A > 1` becomes
      #       `SELECT * FROM Foo WHERE A > 1 ORDER BY A, __name__`
