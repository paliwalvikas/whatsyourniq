# Ruby Client for Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API

[Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API][Product Documentation]:
Manages keys and performs cryptographic operations in a central cloud
service, for direct use by other cloud resources and applications.

## Quick Start
In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
3. [Enable the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudkms.googleapis.com)
4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-kms/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html)

### Installation
```
$ gem install google-cloud-kms
```

### Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/kms"

# Create a client for a project and given credentials
kms = Google::Cloud::Kms.new credentials: "/path/to/keyfile.json"

# Where to create key rings
key_ring_parent = kms.class.location_path "my-project", "us-central1"

# Create a new key ring
key_ring = kms.create_key_ring key_ring_parent, "my-ring", {}
puts "Created at #{Time.new key_ring.create_time.seconds}"

# Iterate over created key rings
kms.list_key_rings(key_ring_parent).each do |key_ring|
  puts "Found ring called #{key_ring.name}"
end
```

### Next Steps
- Read the [Client Library Documentation][] for Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API
  to see other available methods on the client.
- Read the [Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
  to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
- View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
  to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest)
that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
