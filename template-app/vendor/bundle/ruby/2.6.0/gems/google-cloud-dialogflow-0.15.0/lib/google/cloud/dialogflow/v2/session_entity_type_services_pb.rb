          # Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are
          # meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name
          # such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent
          # actionable data for your application.

          # Session entity types are referred to as **User** entity types and are
          # entities that are built for an individual user such as
          # favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. You can redefine a session
          # entity type at the session level.
